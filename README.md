# Magic_01
 This program generates an n x n magic square, where n is an odd number entered by the user. A magic square is a square grid filled with numbers, where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. In this program, we use a simple algorithm to generate the magic square. We start by placing the number 1 in the center of the first row, and then we fill in the rest of the square by moving up and to the right. If we go off the top or right side of the square, we wrap around to the bottom or left side. If the next cell is already filled, we move down one row instead. Finally, we print out the completed magic square.
